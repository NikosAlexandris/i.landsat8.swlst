DESCRIPTION
-----------

*i.landsat8.swlst* is an implementation of a robust and practical Slit-Window
(SW) algorithm estimating land surface temperature (LST), from the Thermal
Infra-Red Sensor (TIRS) aboard Landsat 8 with an accuracy of better than 1.0
K. [1]


### Overview

The components of the algorithm estimating LST values are at-satellite
brightness temperature (BT); land surface emissivity (LSE); and the coefficients of
the main Split-Window equation (SWC).

LSEs are derived from an established look-up table linking the FROM-GLC
classification scheme to average emissivities. The NDVI and the FVC are *not*
computed each time an LST estimation is requested. Read [0] for details.

The SWC depend on each pixel's column water vapor (CWV). CWV values are
retrieved based on a modified Split-Window Covariance-Variance Matrix Ratio
method (MSWCVMR) [1, 2]. **Note**, the spatial discontinuity found in the images of
the retrieved CWV, is attributed to the data gap in the images caused by stray
light outside of the FOV of the TIRS instrument [2]. In addition, the size of
the spatial window querying for CWV values in adjacent pixels, is a key
parameter of the MSWCVMR method. It influences accuracy and performance.

At-satellite brightness temperatures are derived from the TIRS channels 10 and
11. Prior to any processing, these are filtered for clouds and their quantized
digital numbers converted to at-satellite temperature values.

Hence, to produce an LST map, the algorithm requires at minimum:

- TIRS bands 10 and 11
- the acquisition's metadata file (MTL)
- a Finer Resolution Observation & Monitoring of Global Land Cover (FROM-GLC) product

### Details

A new refinement of the generalized split-window algorithm proposed by
Wan (2014) [19] is added with a quadratic term of the difference amongst
the brightness temperatures (Ti, Tj) of the adjacent thermal infrared
channels, which can be expressed as (equation 2 in [0])

`LST = b0 + [b1 + b2 * (1-e)/e + b3 * (De/e2)] * (Ti+T)/j2 + [b4 + b5 * (1-e)/e + b6 * (De/e2)] * (Ti-Tj)/2 + b7 * (Ti-Tj)^2`

where:

-   `Ti` and `Tj` are Top of Atmosphere brightness temperatures measured in
    channels `i` (\~11.0 microns) and `j` (\~12.0 µm), respectively
-   from
    http://landsat.usgs.gov/band\_designations\_landsat\_satellites.php:
    -   Band 10, Thermal Infrared (TIRS) 1, 10.60-11.19, 100\*(30)
    -   Band 11, Thermal Infrared (TIRS) 2, 11.50-12.51, 100\*(30)
-   e is the average emissivity of the two channels (i.e., `e = 0.5 [ei + ej]`)
-   De is the channel emissivity difference (i.e., `De = ei - ej`)
-   `bk` (k = 0, 1, ... 7) are the algorithm coefficients derived from a
    simulated dataset.


In the above equations,

-   `dk` (k = 0, 1...6) and `ek` (k = 1, 2, 3, 4) are the algorithm
    coefficients;
-   `w` is the Column Water Vapor;
-   `e` and `De` are the average emissivity and emissivity difference of two
    adjacent thermal channels, respectively, which are similar to
    Equation (2);
-   and `fk` (k = 0 and 1) is related to the influence of the atmospheric
    transmittance and emissivity, i.e., `fk = f(ei, ej, ti, tji)`.

### Comparing to other split-window algorithms

From the paper:

> Note that the algorithm (Equation (6a)) proposed by Jimenez-Munoz et al. added
> column water vapor (CWV) directly to estimate LST. Rozenstein et al. used CWV
> to estimate the atmospheric transmittance (`ti`, `tj`) and optimize retrieval
> accuracy explicitly. Therefore, if the atmospheric CWV is unknown or cannot be
> obtained successfully, neither of the two algorithms in Equations (6a) and (6b)
> will work. By contrast, although the current algorithm also needs CWV to
> determine the coefficients, it still works for unknown CWVs because the
> coefficients are obtained regardless of the CWV, as shown in Table 1 [0].

NOTES
-----

### Cloud Masking

The first important step of the algorithm is cloud screening. The module
offers two ways to achieve this:

1.  use of the Quality Assessment band and some user-defined QA pixel
    value
2.  use an external cloud map as an inverted MASK

### Calibration of TIRS channels 10, 11

#### Conversion to Spectral Radiance

Conversion of Digital Numbers to TOA Radiance. OLI and TIRS band data
can be converted to TOA spectral radiance using the radiance rescaling
factors provided in the metadata file:

`Ll = ML * Qcal + AL`

where:

-   `Ll` = TOA spectral radiance (Watts/( m2 \* srad \* microns))
-   `ML` = Band-specific multiplicative rescaling factor from the metadata
    (RADIANCE_MULT_BAND_x, where x is the band number)
-   `AL` = Band-specific additive rescaling factor from the metadata
    (RADIANCE_ADD_BAND_x, where x is the band number)
-   `Qcal` = Quantized and calibrated standard product pixel values (DN)

#### Conversion to at-Satellite Temperature

Conversion to At-Satellite Brightness Temperature TIRS band data can be
converted from spectral radiance to brightness temperature using the
thermal constants provided in the metadata file:

`T = K2 / ln((K1/Ll) + 1)`

where:

-   `T` = At-satellite brightness temperature (K)
-   `Ll` = TOA spectral radiance (Watts/(m^2 \* srad \* microns)), below
    'DUMMY_RADIANCE'
-   `K1` = Band-specific thermal conversion constant from the metadata
    (K1_CONSTANT_BAND_x, where x is the band number, 10 or 11)
-   `K2` = Band-specific thermal conversion constant from the metadata
    (K2_CONSTANT_BAND_x, where x is the band number, 10 or 11)

### Land Surface Emissivity

Determination of LSEs (overview of Section 3.2)

1.  The FROM-GLC (30m) contains 10 types of land covers (cropland,
    forest, grassland, shrubland, wetland, waterbody, tundra,
    impervious, barren land and snow-ice).

2.  Deriving emissivities for each land cover class by using different
    combinations of three BRDF kernel models (geometrical, volumetric
    and specular models)

3.  Vegetation and ground emissivity spectra for the BRDF models
    selected from the MODIS University of California, Santa Barbara
    (UCSB) Emissivity Library

4.  Estimating FVC (to obtain emissivity of land cover with temporal
    variation) from NDVI based on Carlson (1997) and Sobrino (2001)

5.  Finally, establishing the average emissivity Look-Up table

### Column Water Vapor

Retrieving atmospheric CWV from Landsat8 TIRS data based on the modified
split-window covariance and variance ratio (MSWCVR).

Algorithm Coefficients (overview of Section 3.1)

1. The CWV is divided into 5 sub-ranges with an overlap of 0.5
   g/cm2 between 2 adjacent sub-ranges: [0.0, 2.5], [2.0, 3.5], [3.0, 4.5],
   [4.0, 5.5] and [5.0, 6.3] g/cm2.

3. The CWV is retrieved from a modified split-window covariance and variance ratio method.

4. However, given the somewhat unsuccessful CWV retrieval, a group of
   coefficients for the entire CWV range is calculated to ensure the spatial
   continuity of the LST product.

#### Modified Split-Window Covariance-Variance Method

With a vital assumption that the atmosphere is unchanged over the
neighboring pixels, the MSWCVR method relates the atmospheric CWV to the
ratio of the upward transmittances in two thermal infrared bands,
whereas the transmittance ratio can be calculated based on the TOA
brightness temperatures of the two bands. Considering N adjacent pixels,
the CWV in the MSWCVR method is estimated as:

-   `cwv = c0 + c1*(tj/ti) + c2*(tj/ti)^2` (3a)

where:

-   `tj/ti` \~ `Rji = SUM [(Tik-Ti\_mean) \* (Tjk-Tj\_mean)] / SUM[(Tik-Tj\_mean)\^2]`

In Equation (3a):

- `c0`, `c1` and `c2` are coefficients obtained from simulated data;
- `t` is the band effective atmospheric transmittance;
- `N` is the number of adjacent pixels (excluding water and cloud pixels) in a spatial window of size `n` (i.e., `N = n x n`);
- `Ti,k` and `Tj,k` are top of atmosphere brightness temperatures (K) of bands `i` and `j` for the `k`th pixel;
- `mean(Ti)` and `mean(Tj)` are the mean (or median -- not implemented yet) brightness temperatures of the `N` pixels for the two bands.

**Note**, while the CWV estimation accuracy increases with larger windows (up to a certain level), the performance (speed) of the module decreases. Generally recommended window sizes are 5, 7, 9.

The regression coefficients:

- `c0` = -9.674
- `c1` = 0.653
- `c2` = 9.087

where obtained by:

- 946 cloud-free TIGR atmospheric profiles,
- the new high accurate atmospheric radiative transfer model MODTRAN 5.2
- simulating the band effective atmospheric transmittance Model analysis
  indicated that this method will obtain a CWV RMSE of about 0.5 g/cm^2.

The algorithm will not cause significant uncertainty to the final LST retrieval
with known CWV, but it will lead some error to the LST result for the cases
without input CWV. To reduce this effect, the authors are trying to find more
representative profiles to optimize the current algorithm.

Details about the columnw water vapor retrieval can be found in:

Ren, H.; Du, C.; Qin, Q.; Liu, R.; Meng, J.; Li, J. Atmospheric water
vapor retrieval from landsat 8 and its validation. In Proceedings of the
IEEE International Geosciene and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS),
Quebec, QC, Canada, July 2014; pp. 3045--3048.

### Split-Window Algorithm

The algorithm removes the atmospheric effect through differential
atmospheric absorption in the two adjacent thermal infrared channels
centered at about 11 and 12 microns. The linear or non-linear combination of
the brightness temperatures is finally applied for LST estimation based
on the equation:

`LST = b0 + + (b1 + b2 \* ((1-ae)/ae)) + + b3 \* (de/ae) \* ((t10 + t11)/2) + + (b4 + b5 \* ((1-ae)/ae) + b6 \* (de/ae\^2)) \* ((t10 - t11)/2) + + b7 \* (t10 - t11)\^2`

To reduce the influence of the CWV error on the LST, for a CWV within
the overlap of two adjacent CWV sub-ranges, we first use the
coefficients from the two adjacent CWV sub-ranges to calculate the two
initial temperatures and then use the average of the initial
temperatures as the pixel LST.

For example, the LST pixel with a CWV of 2.1 g/cm2 is estimated by using
the coefficients of [0.0, 2.5] and [2.0, 3.5]. This process initially
reduces the **delta-**LSTinc and improves the spatial continuity of the LST
product.

EXAMPLES
--------

At minimum, the module requires the following in order to derive a land
surface temperature map:

1.  The Landsat8 scene's acquisition metadata (MTL file)

2.  Bands 10, 11 and QA

3.  A FROM-GLC product for the same Path and Row as the Landsat scene to be
    processed

The shortest call for processing a complete Landsat8 scene normally is:
<div class="code">
    i.landsat8.swlst mtl=MTL prefix=B landcover=FROM_GLC -n
</div>


where:

- `mtl=` the name of the MTL metadata file (normally with a `.txt` extension)

- `prefix=` the prefix of the band names imported in GRASS GIS' data base

- `landcover=` the name of the FROM-GLC map that covers the extent of the
  Landsat8 scene under processing

- the `n` flag will set zero digital number values, which may represent NoData
  in the original bands, to NULL. This option is probably unnecessary for
  smaller regions in which there are no NoData pixels present.

The pixel value 61440 is selected automatically to build a cloud
mask. At the moment, only a single pixel value may be requested from the
Quality Assessment band. For details, refer to
[http://landsat.usgs.gov/L8QualityAssessmentBand.php USGS' webpage for
Landsat8 Quality Assessment Band]

`window` is an important option. It defines the size of the spatial window
querying for column water vapor values. Small window sizes introduce a spatial
discontinuation effect in the final LST image. Larger window sizes lead to more
accurate results, at the cost of performance. However, too large window sizes
should be avoided as they would include large variations of land and
atmospheric conditions. In [2] it is stated:

> A small window size n (N = n * n, see equation (1a)) cannot ensure a high
> correlation between two bands' temperatures due to the instrument noise. In
> contrast, the size cannot be too large because the variations in the surface
> and atmospheric conditions become larger as the size increases.

An example instructing a spatial window of size 7^2 is:

<div class="code">
    i.landsat8.swlst mtl=MTL prefix=B landcover=FROM_GLC window=7
</div>


In order to restrict the processing in to the currently set
computational region, the *-k* flag can be used:

<div class="code">
    i.landsat8.swlst mtl=MTL prefix=B landcover=FROM_GLC -k 
</div>


The Landsat8 scene's time and date of acquisition may be applied to the LST
(and to the optionally requested CWV) map via the `t` flag.

<div class="code">
    i.landsat8.swlst mtl=MTL prefix=B landcover=FROM_GLC -k -t
</div>


The output land surface temperature map maybe be delivered in Celsius degrees
(units and appropriate color table) via the *-c* flag:

<div class="code">
    i.landsat8.swlst mtl=MTL prefix=B landcover=FROM_GLC -k -c
</div>


A user defined map for clouds, instead of relying on the Quality
Assessment band, can be used via the `clouds` option:

<div class="code">
    i.landsat8.swlst mtl=MTL prefix=B landcover=FROM_GLC clouds=Cloud_Map -k
</div>


Using the `prefix_bt` option, the in-between at-satellite brightness
temperature maps may be saved for re-use in sub-sequent trials via the `t10`
and `t11` options. Using the `t10` and `t11` options, will skip the conversion
from digital numbers for bands B10 and B11. Alternatively, any existing
at-satellite brightness temperature maps maybe used via the `t10/11` options.
For example using the `t11` option instead of `b11`:

<div class="code">
    i.landsat8.swlst mtl=MTL b10=B10 t11=AtSatellite_Temperature_11 landcover=FROM_GLC -k
</div>

or using both `t10` and `t11`:

<div class="code">
    i.landsat8.swlst mtl=MTL t10=AtSatellite_Temperature_10 t11=AtSatellite_Temperature_11 landcover=FROM_GLC -k
</div>


A faster run is achieved by using existing maps for all in-between processing steps:
at-satellite temperatures, cloud and emissivity maps.

    * At-satellite temperature maps (optiones `t10`, `t11`) may be derived via
      the i.landsat.toar module. Note that `i.landsat.toar` does not
      process single bands selectively.

    * The `cloud` option can be any user-defined map. Essentialy, it applies
      the given map as an inverted mask.

    * The emissivity maps, derived by the module itself, can be saved once
      via the `emissivity_out` and `delta_emissivity_out` options and used
      afterwards via the `emissivity` and `delta_emissivity` options. Expert
      users, however, may use emissivity maps from other sources directly.
      An example command may be:

<div class="code">
    i.landsat8.swlst t10=BT10 t11=BT11 clouds=Cloud_Map emissivity=Average_Emissivity_Map delta_emissivity=Delta_Emissivity_Map landcover=FROM_GLC -n
</div>


Expert users may need to request for a "fixed" average surface
emissivity, in order to perform the algorithm for a single land cover
class (one from the classes defined in the FROM-GLC classification
scheme) via the `emissivity_class` option. Consequently,
`emissivity_class` cannot be used at the same time with the `landover`
option.

<div class="code">
    i.landsat8.swlst mtl=MTL b10=B10 t11=AtSatellite_Temperature_11 qab=BQA emissivity_class="Croplands" -c 
</div>


A *transparent* run-through of *what kind of* and *how* the module
performs its computations, may be requested via the use of both the
*--v* and *-i* flags:

<div class="code">
    i.landsat8.swlst mtl=MTL prefix=B landcover=FROM_GLC -i --v  
</div>

The above will print out a description for each individual processing
step, as well as the actual mathematical epxressions applied via GRASS
GIS' `r.mapcalc` module.
